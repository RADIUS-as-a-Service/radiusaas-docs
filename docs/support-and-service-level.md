## Service level

### Service hours

Our service is operated 24x7

### Service availability

The service availability goal is 99,5%. It is calculated by using the following formula:&#x20;

`service availability` = (`service period` - `downtime`) / `service period`&#x20;

where

* `Service period` is the corresponding calendar month\
  and&#x20;
* `Downtime` is the accumulated amount of time where the RADIUSaaS service is unavailable. The RADIUSaaS service is considered unavailable, when there is no connectivity between the RADIUSaaS service and the internet.

Service outages must be reported by customers to our support as soon as possible and at the latest within 24 hours after occurrence.

In the event of a reported service outage, affected customers are entitled to apply within one week for the following credits for the affected calendar month:

* service availability < 99.5% => 10%
* service availability < 99.0% => 25%
