# Insights

### Dashboards

In your Overview you have a short overview about the status for the logged in users over the day.&#x20;

### Authentications

Under Authentications you have tables to get an overview on how many times someone has been logged in and an overview about why authentications are failing.&#x20;

### Creating Custom Visualisation

The clip below shows how you can modify or replace a widget to better suit your needs. For example, the current IPs widget can only display 30 IPs, whereas your environment requires 100.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the default visualization will be reset due to instance maintenance. Therefore, we recommend creating an additional visualization for your purposes.
{% endhint %}
