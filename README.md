# Welcome

{% hint style="success" %}
## **log4j**

RADIUSaaS is **not** affected by the **log4j** vulnerability ([CVE-2021-44228](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228)).
{% endhint %}

RADIUSaaS offers easy and secure authentication for accessing network resources. It delivers the comfort, reliability, and scalability of a native cloud SaaS. Supported protocols are RADIUS as well as RadSec. Authentication is based on certificates. RADIUSaaS can validate in general every certificate which can be used for client authentication. However to be able to lock somone with a revoked certificate out of your network, choose a CA that support the OCSP protocol. RADIUSaaS automatically generates XML configuration files for WIFI and LAN profiles.
