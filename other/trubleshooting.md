# Troubleshooting

## Client View

### Wrong XML&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png>)

Check that your client has a certificate to authenticate and that you are using the correct [WiFi configuration profile](../azure/microsoft-intune/wifi-profile/) or [XML](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/xml.md#wifi).

### Trusted Root issues&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

Check that you've done the following:&#x20;

* Told your RADIUS Server which certificates are allowed to connect as described [here](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/trusted-roots.md#add)
* Imported the active RADIUS Server certificate as trusted root on your client as described [here](../azure/microsoft-intune/trusted-root.md#to-add-a-trusted-root-profile-for-your-clients)

Also check your [Logs](../portal/insights/log.md#logs). There is a detailed description of the error. Maybe it's [this](trubleshooting.md#fatal-decrypt-error) issue.

If your Clients need to verify on connecting the first time, and you're seeing this dialog:

Make sure that you have referenced the Server certificate in your WiFi Profile:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (68) (1) (1).png>)

## Server View

### Unknown CA

if you see something like this in your [Logs](../portal/insights/log.md#logs):

```
Mon Jul 12 12:38:09 2021 : ERROR: (14872) eap_tls:   ERROR: SSL says error 20 : unable to get local issuer certificate
Mon Jul 12 12:38:09 2021 : ERROR: (14872) eap_tls: ERROR: TLS Alert write:fatal:unknown CA
Mon Jul 12 12:38:09 2021 : Error: tls: TLS_accept: Error in error
Mon Jul 12 12:38:09 2021 : Auth: (14872) Login incorrect (eap_tls: SSL says error 20 : unable to get local issuer certificate): [host/8dc38402-20fb-41db-a8f3-4e4e95637173/<via Auth-Type = eap>] (from client contoso port 1 cli 18-9K-EA-0H-7F-C5)
```

It can be one of this options:&#x20;

1. Your RADIUS server doesn't know the issuer of the certificate which was used for authentication. Add your CA as described [here](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/trusted-roots.md#add).
2. Your Client doesn't know the **Server certificate** and rejects the connection. Check that you've added your **Server certificate** as described [here](../azure/microsoft-intune/trusted-root.md#adding-a-trusted-root-profile-for-your-clients).
3. You've changed/added a new **Server certificate** and your XML profile on the client is using the old one. In that case, please double-check that you've either updated your WiFi/Wired profile or re-generated your [XML](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/xml.md#wifi) after adding the certificates and pushed that to your clients.&#x20;

### Fatal decrypt error

If you can see something like this in your [Logs](../portal/insights/log.md#logs):

```

```

... then it is probably a bug of the TPM software on your Windows machines. More information on that can be found in the [SCEPman documentation](https://docs.scepman.com/certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/windows-10).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The setting Key Storage Provider (KSP) determines the storage location of the private key for the end-user certificates. Storage in the TPM is more secure than software storage, because the TPM provides an additional layer of security to prevent key theft. However, there is **a bug in some older TPM firmware versions** that invalidates some signatures created with a TPM-backed private key. In such cases, the certificate cannot be used for EAP authentication as it is common for Wi-Fi and VPN connections. Affected TPM firmware versions include:

* STMicroelectronics: 71.12, 73.4.17568.4452, 71.12.17568.4100
* Intel: 11.8.50.3399, 2.0.0.2060
* Infineon: 7.63.3353.0

If you use TPM with this firmware, either update your firmware to a newer version or select "Software KSP" as key storage provider.
