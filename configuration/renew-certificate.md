# Server Certificate Renewal

**Before continuing, you need to answer the following questions:**

* Do you want to bring your own certificate (e.g. from SCEPman) or use a certificate created by your RADIUSaaS instance?
* Are you deploying user or device client authentication certificates?

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend starting the renewal process of the RADIUS server certificate **8 - 10 weeks** before it expires for the following reason.

If you are using the **legacy** **self-signed** server certificate we used to provide, RADIUSaaS will **auto-renew** the server certificate 30 days **prior** to its expiry (**Valid until** date). If you miss this deadline, you can no longer control the activation of a new RADIUS server certificate.
{% endhint %}

## Part 1

### Certificate Creation

The below screenshot demonstrates the two options for creating / uploading a new server certificate.

* If you would like to use the free certificates that can be created from the RADIUSaaS Admin Portal, please create your own CA as described [here](../admin-portal/settings/settings-server.md#bring-your-own-certificate).
* If you would like to use your own certificate instead, select **PEM or PKCS#12 encoded Certificate** in the **Add** certificate dialog, select the certificate name and upload the public and private key. If you selected PKCS#12, this contains both public and private key.

{% hint style="info" %}
Download the certificate after creating it as you will need it for the Intune profiles later on.
{% endhint %}

### Intune Profiles

1. Deploy the new **server certificate/trusted root** to your clients as described [here](../profile-deployment/jamf-pro/server-trust.md) by creating a **new** profile.
2. Update your **existing** WiFi or wired profile(s)
   * If you have used the Intune Wizard for the creation of your network profile(s), edit all relevant profiles by **adding a second trusted server certificate**. Do not forget to add a second server name under **Certificate server names** in case the new certificate has a different domain.
   * If you have used a custom profile for the creation of your network profile(s), re-download the XML generated by RADIUSaaS from [here](../admin-portal/settings/trusted-roots.md#xml), and replace it in your existing profile. Both server certificate thumbprints are automatically included in the XML.&#x20;
3. Wait **until all your clients** have received the updated profile(s).

### Jamf Profiles

1. Deploy the new **server certificate/trusted root** to your clients as described [here](../profile-deployment/microsoft-intune/trusted-root.md#adding-a-trusted-root-profile-for-your-clients) by creating a **new** profile.
2. Update your **existing** WiFi or wired profile(s) by adding a second common name under **Trusted Server Certificate Names**
3. Wait **until all your clients** have received the updated profile(s).

### WiFi & LAN infrastructure

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is only necessary if you're using [RadSec](../details.md#what-is-radsec).
{% endhint %}

Upload the new **Server certificate** to your Access Points or network switch device.&#x20;

## Part 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend a **minimum waiting period of 4 weeks** between completing Part 1 and starting with Part 2.
{% endhint %}

After the updated profiles have successfully been deployed to all your clients (depending on the size of the deployment this may take weeks since some employees might be on holidays), you can take the last step and perform the certificate switch-over in your RADIUSaaS Admin Portal.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Only** proceed with the next step if you are certain that all your clients received the new/updated profiles. Otherwise, they will not be able to connect to your network afterwards.
{% endhint %}

* Activate the new server certificate as described [here](../admin-portal/settings/settings-server.md#certificate-activation).
