# Server Certificate Renewal

**Before continuing, you need to answer the following questions:**&#x20;

* Do you want to buy your own certificate or do you want to use the free certificate which your instance can create for you?
* Are you deploying user- or device client authentication certificates?&#x20;

## Part 1

### Certificate Creation

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (81) (1).png>)

1. Create/upload a new server certificate (download the certificate afterwards as you will need it for the Intune profiles later on).
   * If you would like to use the free certificates that can directly be created from the RADIUSaaS Admin Portal, please create your own CA as described [here](../portal/settings/settings-server/certificates.md#custom-cas).
   * If you would like to use your own certificate instead, select **PEM encoded Certificate** in the **Add** certificate dialog, select the certificate name and upload the public and private key.
2. Generate a new XML if you are deploying **device certificates** as described [here](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/xml.md#wifi).

### Intune Profiles

1. Deploy the new s**erver certificate** to your clients as described [here](../azure/trusted-root.md#adding-a-trusted-root-profile-for-your-clients) by creating a **new** profile.
2. Update your **existing** WiFi or wired profile(s)
   * If you have used the Intune Wizard for the creation of your network profile(s), edit all relevant profiles by **adding a second trusted server certificate**. Do not forget to add a second server name under **Certificate server names** in case the new certificate has a different domain.
   * If you have used a custom profile for the creation of your network profile(s), re-download the XML generated by RADIUSaaS from [here](../portal/settings/settings-trusted-roots/xml.md), and replace it in your existing profile. Both server certificate thumbprints are automatically included in the XML.&#x20;
3. Wait **until all your clients** have received the updated profile(s).

### WiFi & LAN infrastructure

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is only necessary if you're using [RadSec](../details.md#what-is-radsec).
{% endhint %}

Upload the new **Server certificate** to your Access Points or network switch device.&#x20;

## Part 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend a **minimum waiting period of 4 weeks** between completing Part 1 and starting with Part 2.
{% endhint %}

After the updated profiles have successfully been deployed to all your clients (depending on the size of the deployment this may take weeks since some employees might be on holidays), you can take the last step and perform the certificate switch-over in your RADIUSaaS Admin Portal.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Only** proceed with the next step if you are certain that all your clients received the new/updated profiles. Otherwise, they will not be able to connect to your network afterwards.
{% endhint %}

1. Activate the new server certificate as described [here](../portal/settings/settings-server/#certificate-activation).
