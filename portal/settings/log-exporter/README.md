  The Log Exporter allows you to push RADIUSaaS Logs to an external SIEM,
  monitoring and alerting system
---

# ðŸ†• Log Exporter

### General

Logs will be **fetched every 60 seconds** and sent to your configured **Export Target(s)**. Currently, the Log Exporter can connect to the following target systems:

* [Microsoft Teams Channel](teams.md)
* [Azure Log Analytics Workspace](log-analytics.md)
* [Generic Webhook (JSON)](generic-webhook.md)

The Log Exporter allows you to configure a specific **Message Filter** for each target. For example:&#x20;

* Send every entry where a user was not able to login to a **Log Analytics Workspace**
* Send every failed TCP connection to a **Microsoft Teams Channel**

### Message Filter

The **Message Filter** that can be configured for each target helps you to only receive those logs, that are really relevant for your monitoring and alerting system.

The filter can be configured to only consider logs from certain sources/sub-system from the RADIUSaaS platform:

* Rule Engine
* Authorization System
* Proxy Authentication

Furthermore, the log level can be configured for each of those sub-systems.

If you are familiar with reading the RADIUSaaS' [raw log data](../../insights/log.md) and have already identified a set of  messages that are of interest for you, you can very easily derive from those messages the suitable filter settings for export. Therefore, below table provides a mapping from the log message origin (sub-system) to the `tags` property as well as from the log level to the `level` property of each log message.

| Filter               | Tag      | Level                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rule Engine          | `engine` | <p>Success = <code>INFO</code><br>Failed = <code>WARNING</code><br>Error = <code>ERROR</code></p>                                     |
| Authorization System | `detail` | <p>Requests = <code>debug</code><br>Success = <code>info</code><br>Failed = <code>warning</code><br>Error = <code>error</code></p>    |
| Proxy Authentication | `proxy`  | <p>Connections = <code>debug</code><br>Success = <code>info</code><br>Failed = <code>warning</code><br>Error = <code>error</code></p> |

### Message

No matter which target type(s) you have selected, you will have to edit the data template describing how the export message should be structured using **Jinja2** as template engine:\
[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/)

The Log Exporter has access to every field in a log message that is hierarchically located under the`_source` property. It is made available through the `data` object in the **Message** editor.
