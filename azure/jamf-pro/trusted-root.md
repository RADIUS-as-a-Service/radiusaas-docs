# Trusted Root

{% hint style="info" %}
This is only required if you are using a RADIUS server certificate that was issued by a CA that your clients do not already trust. For example, this is not needed if you are bringing your own server certificate issued by SCEPman.
{% endhint %}

### Part 1: Download the RADIUS Server Certificate

When [downloading](../../portal/settings/settings-server/certificates.md#download) the Server certificate, use only the green-marked certificate. This will download the root CA certificate of the issuing CA.

### Part 2: Trust the Server Certificate

1. Log in to your Jamf Pro instance.
2. Choose your correct deployment scope (Computers, Devices or Users). In this example, we have chosen a macOS device (Computers).
3. Navigate to an existing Configuration Profile or create a new one and give the profile a meaningful name, e.g. "Corp-WiFi-802.1X".
4. Add a "**Certificate**" payload
5. Provide a meaningful **Certificate Name**, e.g. "RADIUSaaS Server Root CA"
6. Under "**Select Certificate Option**" select "**Upload**"
7. Upload the \*.cer file containing the certificate you have downloaded in Part 1. A password is not required, since it is only the public key part that is contained in the file and that needs to be uploaded.
8. Select "**Allow all apps access**"
9. Unselect "**Allow export from keychain**"
10. Click "**Save**"
11. Under "**Scope**" assign the profile to the relevant audience
